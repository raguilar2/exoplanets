# Finding Exoplanets

This project uses Kepler Mission's light intensity data to classify stars as exoplanet-stars or non-exoplanet-stars. Logistic regression, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosting were used to classify the data. The data were used to create new variables to explore the relationship between light intensity and the likelihood of a star having an exoplanet. One of the variables appears to yield perfect classification. The data management, model building, report, cleaned datasets, and models can be found in this repository.

The original datasets are too large to include, but can be found (with a description of the data) here:
